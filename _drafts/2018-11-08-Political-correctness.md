People should be able to say what they want, but they shouldn't use violence at all.

only when you say it, people will know about it.

It's okay to hate, to love, to be sad, feel any emotion.. but it's not okay is violence

Words hurts, but it depends a lot on the person, whereas physical violence is tangible. People offend forgets the great connection between body and mind. 

We should focus on develop emotional stable people. Our goal is not to offend is to learn how to understand others and control our emotions.
it's like having an injury doing sports, you can train a lot to prevent injuries, but injuries happnen but it was your job to train your body so the injury doesn't affect too much and will be easier for you to recover. 

It's doesn't matter what you say, you will for sure offense somebody.

What other people say doesn't defines you.

when people is more relax, is less likely to make damage and more likely to have peaceful live. 





To make your first blog post, just create a new markdown file in the `_posts` directory with the title format `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`. Posts follow the simple [markdown syntax](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and can include a wide array of multimedia formats.

# This is a header

And this is a simple paragraph.

## Smaller header

This is how you **bold** & *italicize* text.

Here is some `inline code`.

Here some code with line numbers
{% highlight c linenos %}
blockCode() {
	return true;
}
{% endhighlight %}

some code :
```c
blockCode() {
	return true;
}
```

# Another header

And here's a list:

* Item 1
* Item 2
