“The principles you know determines what you get” (Sunday Adelaja)

Inspired by [Principles For Success by Ray Dalio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9XGUpQZY38), I decided to list the principles. 

1. Keep it simple
2. Be calm and relaxed
3. Improve yourself 
4. Enjoy life
5. Embrace your uniqueness
