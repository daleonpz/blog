In the last two months I've been taking photos, recording videos, writing and doing plasteline sculptures.

All of these activities can be called art. 

Two days ago, I just got a revelation after staring at the photo collage on my wall. I made this collage with around 70 of the photos that I liked the most.

I understood something...

I understood what is art and why it is important in our life. 

"Art is about representing in reality the way you understand your feelings"

In that sense, art is important because it helps you to understand and embrace your feelings. And ultimately, to know yourself.
