title: Basics STM32 Development - STM32CubeF7
category: programming
---

I will explain the STM32CubeF7 because I bought the STM32F746G-discovery development kit [link](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/32f746gdiscovery.html). 

STM32CubeF7 firmware consists in 3 abstraction layers:
- Level 0:
    - Board support package (BSP): This layer offers a set of APIs relative to the hardware components in the hardware boards (Audio codec, I/O expander, Touchscreen, SRAM driver, LCD drivers). Of course this package is only usefull if you are using a development kit. 
    - Hardware abstraction layer (HAL): The HAL layer provides the low level drivers and the hardware interfacing methods to interact with the upper level (ADC, UART, SPI) 
    - Low Layer (LL): Provides APIs at register level. Thus, a good understanding of the microcontroller architecture is needed.  
    - Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS): it is a  vendor-independent hardware abstraction layer for Cortex-M processor, and supports of digital signal processing and RTOS.

- Level 1:
    - Middleware: Libraries supporting complex pieces of software such as USB protocol, TCP/IP and Real time operating systems (RTOS).

- Level 2:
