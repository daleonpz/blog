title: Understanding STM32F7xx GPIOs
category: programming
---

I'm using a discovery board based on STM32F74XX microcontroller, and in this post I'll explain the how GPIOs works and how to configure them using C code. 

# Electrical diagram 
A general purpose Input/Output pin has the following structure when is configured as an **input** and as an **output**.

![I/O diagram](/images/posts/gpio_diagram.png)

(a) **Input**: _IN_ is the signal from the microprocessor, _Ru_ is the pull-up resistor, _Rd_ is the pull-down resistor.  
(b) **Output**: _OUT_ is the signal from the microprocessor, which goes to two enhancement MOSFETs (_P-MOS_ and _N-MOS_).  


The I/O pins can have **several states**:
- Input: 
    - **Pull-up**: in this mode the input voltage of the pin is fixed to **VCC** or **1** when there is **no input signal**
    - **Pull-down**: in this mode the input voltage of the pin is fixed to **VSS** or **0** when there is **no input signal**
    - **Floating**: in this mode the value of the input is **undefined** when there is **no input signal** because the pin is _floating_.

- Output: 
    - **push-pull**: is the normal or most common state, in this state the output can be **VCC / 1** when _OUT_ is **1**, or  **VSS/0** when _OUT_ is **0**.
    - **open-drain**: this state is similar to the floating state when the pin is configured as input. When _OUT_ is **1** the pin is _floating_ or the _drain_ pin of the MOSFET is _open_, and when _OUT_ is **0** the pin is **VSS**

More detailed information in this application note [AN4899](https://comm.eefocus.com/media/download/index/id-1013834): _STM32 GPIO configuration for hardware settings and low-power consumption_.

Also, when the output is in open-drain state, it can be combined with pull-up/down resistors in order to have a fixed  output voltage when MOSFET is not activated.

There are two  more  possible configurations: _Analog_ and _Alternate function_, but I didn't read about it. Sorry folks. 

# STM32F7 GPIO Registers 
Each general purpose I/O pin has 
- Four 32-bit configuration registers: 
 
    - `GPIOx_MODER` or Mode register: input, output, alternate function or analog
    - `GPIOx_OTYPER` or Output type register: push-pull or open-drain
    - `GPIOx_OSPEEDR` or Output speed register: Low, Medium, High and Very high speed
    - `GPIOx_PUPDR` or Pull-up/Pull-down register: No pull-up/down, pull-up or pull-down
- Two 32-bit data registers: 

    - `GPIOx_IDR`: Input data register
    - `GPIOx_ODR`: Output data register 
- A 32-bit set/reset register `GPIOx_BSRR` 
- A 32-bit locking register `GPIOx_LCKR`
- Two 32-bit alternate function 

where `x` can be from **A** to **K**.

# GPIO basic configuration
In order to configure our GPIO I need basically to set up the configuration registers.
Here is a table that summarizes the port configuration for just one pin:

![Port bit configuration table](/images/posts/gpio_pin_table_conf.png)


**Note**: Each port (A to K) has 16 pins `pyy` (yy from 00 to 15), so in the following section we will focus only on the number of bits needed for each pin to setup the registers.

## GPIO port mode register (GPIOx_MODER)
Each pin `pyy`  needs 2-bits for mode, so `GPIOx_MODER` register could be seen as follows:

```
 -------------------------------
 | p15 | p14 | ... | p01 | p00 |
 -------------------------------
       |     |     |     |     |
       30    28    04    02    00
```

where `pyy` can have the following values:
- `00`: input mode
- `01`: output mode
- `10`: alternate function mode
- `11`: analog mode

As an extra note, some ports have a reset value different from `0x0000 0000`
- `0xA800 0000` for port A
- `0x0000 0280` for port B


## GPIO port output type register (GPIOx_OTYPER) 
Each pin `pyy` only needs 1-bit for type, so  `GPIOx_OTYPER` register could be seen as follows:

```
 ----------------------------------------------
 |   RESERVED   | p15 | p14 | ... | p01 | p00 |
 ----------------------------------------------
                      |     |     |     |     |
                      15    14    02    01    00
```

where `pyy` can have the following values:
- `0`: Output push-pull
- `1`: Output open-drain

The `RESERVED` bits (31:16) must be kept at `0x0000`

## GPIO port output speed register (GPIOx_OSPEEDR)
Each pin uses 2 bits for speed, so `GPIOx_OSPEEDR` register could be seen as follows:

```
 -------------------------------
 | p15 | p14 | ... | p01 | p00 |
 -------------------------------
       |     |     |     |     |
       30    28    04    02    00
```

where `pyy` can have the following values:
- `00`: low speed (up to 3MHz)
- `01`: medium speed (up to 50MHz)
- `10`: high speed (up to 100MHz)
- `11`: very high speed (up to 180MHz)

The values of speed will depends on the microcontroller, load and VCC. Thus, check the datasheet for your microcontroller, in my case the values are shown above. 

As an extra note, some ports have a reset value different from `0x0000 0000`
- `0x0C00 0000` for port A
- `0x0000 00C0` for port B


## GPIO port pull-up/pull-down register (GPIOx_PUPDR)
Each pin uses 2 bits for set up  internal resistors, so `GPIOx_PUPDR` register could be seen as follows:

```
 -------------------------------
 | p15 | p14 | ... | p01 | p00 |
 -------------------------------
       |     |     |     |     |
       30    28    04    02    00
```

where `pyy` can have the following values:
- `00`: no pull-up/down
- `01`: pull-up
- `10`: pull-down
- `11`: Reserved

As an extra note, some ports have a reset value different from `0x0000 0000`
- `0x6400 0000` for port A
- `0x0000 0100` for port B

# Summary
I have described the basic concepts about GPIO in STM32F74XX ARM-based microcontrollers. 
All these concepts were somehow overwhelmed to me, but I hope this post helped you to understand how GPIOs works, and how to set them up.

Cheers!
