title: How do microcontrollers run an application?
category: programming
---

I was learning about how to program microcontrollers in C and I wasn't aware about the importance of startup files, vector tables and the linker.
Basically, this three concepts are needed in order to understand how a microcontroller run an applicaiton. 
I already explained the linker script in a previous [post]({% post_url 2019-03-11-Linker-scripts %}). I recommend to read that post before, in order to understand the next concepts.


# C runtime environment and startup file
C assumes that  _heap_ and _stack_ are already defined, and also that there is a `main` function (check [Hacking function main]({% post_url 2017-03-30-hack-main  %})) 
Thus, one should setup the C runtime environment  in order to run an application, and the startup file is the way to go.
It's usually written in assembly because it's hardware dependent.
This startup file must do at least the following: 

- Copy values from Flash to RAM (`.data`)
- Clear uninitialized RAM (`.bss`)
- Call the `main` function

The following code is an example of a startup file:

```nasm
// Copyright William Ransohoff, Vivonomicon, LLC, 2017

.syntax unified
.cpu cortex-m0
.fpu softvfp
.thumb

// Global values.
.global reset_handler

//
// The Reset handler. Called on reset.
//

.type reset_handler, %function
reset_handler:
  // Set the stack pointer to the end of the stack.
  // The '_estack' value is defined in our linker script.
  LDR  r0, =_estack
  MOV  sp, r0

  // Copy data from flash to RAM data init section.
  // R2 will store our progress along the sidata section.
  MOVS r0, #0
  // Load the start/end addresses of the data section,
  // and the start of the data init section.
  LDR  r1, =_sdata
  LDR  r2, =_edata
  LDR  r3, =_sidata
  B    copy_sidata_loop

  copy_sidata:
    // Offset the data init section by our copy progress.
    LDR  r4, [r3, r0]
    // Copy the current word into data, and increment.
    STR  r4, [r1, r0]
    ADDS r0, r0, #4

  copy_sidata_loop:
    // Unless we've copied the whole data section, copy the
    // next word from sidata->data.
    ADDS r4, r0, r1
    CMP  r4, r2
    BCC  copy_sidata

  // Once we are done copying the data section into RAM,
  // move on to filling the BSS section with 0s.
  MOVS r0, #0
  LDR  r1, =_sbss
  LDR  r2, =_ebss
  B    reset_bss_loop

  // Zero out the BSS segment.
  reset_bss:
    // Store a 0 and increment by a word.
    STR  r0, [r1]
    ADDS r1, r1, #4

  reset_bss_loop:
    // We'll use R1 to count progress here; if we aren't
    // done, reset the next word and increment.
    CMP  r1, r2
    BCC  reset_bss

  // Branch to the 'main' method.
  B    main
.size reset_handler, .-reset_handler
```

The `reset_handler` section must be defined as `ENTRY_POINT` in the linker in order to work as startup point.

# Vector Table
The vector table contains the reset value of the stack pointer, and the start addresses  for all exception handlers including the **reset handler**.
The vector table is described in detail in each microcontroller reference manualr, and it's usually given by the vendor, but you can also write your own, you just only be aware of the addresses.

An snapshot of the vector table for the microcontroller STM32F0 is shown below:

```nasm
.syntax unified
.cpu cortex-m0
.fpu softvfp
.thumb

.global vtable
.global default_interrupt_handler

//  The vector table.

.type vtable, %object
.section .vector_table,"a",%progbits
vtable:
    .word _estack
    .word reset_handler
    .word NMI_handler
    .word hard_fault_handler
    .word 0
    .word 0
    .word 0
    .word 0
    .word 0
    .word 0
    .word 0
    .word SVC_handler
    .word 0
    .word 0
    .word pending_SV_handler
    .word SysTick_handler
    // 16-31
    .word window_watchdog_IRQ_handler
    .word PVD_IRQ_handler
...
```

Note that `.word` means that the vector is 16-bits long. 

# Example
I will show parts of an ELF file dissambly  based on a C code for STM32F0 microcontrollers:

```nasm
main.elf:     file format elf32-littlearm

Disassembly of section .vector_table:

08000000 <vtable>:
 8000000:	20001000 	andcs	r1, r0, r0
 8000004:	080000c5 	stmdaeq	r0, {r0, r2, r6, r7}
 ...
 
Disassembly of section .text:

80000c4 <reset_handler>:
 80000c4: ldr	r0, [pc, #40]	; (80000f0 <reset_bss_loop+0x6>)
 80000c6: mov	sp, r0
 80000c8: movs	r0, #0
 80000ca: ldr	r1, [pc, #40]	; (80000f4 <reset_bss_loop+0xa>)
 80000cc: ldr	r2, [pc, #40]	; (80000f8 <reset_bss_loop+0xe>)
 80000ce: ldr	r3, [pc, #44]	; (80000fc <reset_bss_loop+0x12>)
 80000d0: b.n	80000d8 <copy_sidata_loop>

080000d8 <copy_sidata_loop>:
 ...
 80000e4: b.n	80000ea <reset_bss_loop>
 ...


080000ea <reset_bss_loop>:
 ... 
 80000ee: b.n	8000108 <main>
 ...


08000108 <main>:
...

Disassembly of section .dynamic_allocations:

20000004 <_ssystem_ram>:
	
```

Things to notice:
- **STACK POINTER** is `0x2000 1000`, and defined at the beginnig of `vtable`
- **PROGRAM COUNTER** is `0x0800 00c5`, in reality is `0x0800 00c4` but the least-significant bit should be 1, indicating that the code in that section  is written in Thumb code. Check vector table snapshot above.
- **HEAP** starts at `0x2000 0000` because it's a 4KB SRAM memory. Remember that HEAP is for  dynamic memory allocations  such as `malloc` or `calloc`
- The start up program  jumps from `reset_handler` to `copy_sidata_loop` to `reset_bss_loop` and to `main`.

# Final words
I have presented the basic concepts you should know in order to understand how your C code will be executed in the microcontroller.
I hope you learned as much as I did.
