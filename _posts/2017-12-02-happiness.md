The other day I read a meme in Facebook that said "Happiness in intelligent people is the rarest thing", also I saw a short film based on the idea of social status, money and buying things will make you happy.  

I think in I am quiet smart and I am happy. I like the life I have, I enjoy it and do what I like. And I know many smart people that are happy as well. 
Maybe it is because we have a good balance between "dumbness" and "intelligence". Thus, the statement of intelligent people and not happy, I think it is more related to the idea of do not be confident enough to allow you to do all the "stupid" things you always wanted to do, maybe you always wanted to do some crazy stuff with dominoes.

And about the short film. I think the problem here is that forget that we don't need pretty much nothing in order to be happy. When we were child we had a lot of fun, and we didn't need anything.
Also, who doesn't relax when laying on the grass just doing nothing. 
 Marketing and social media have a lot of influence, but we must do something about it. On the other hand, I asked myself.. the people who are behind all of this, are they really happy?  If they are not, then why do they keep doing that?
