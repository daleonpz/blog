title: Embedded Ada Journey 001 - Finding a starting point
category: programming
---

I want to learn ADA language and also start doing embedded applications, so I was looking around to see if I can get THE book or THE website/blog to start doing things. 
In the end, I couldn't find anything good enough. Maybe since I didn't have any clear idea from where to start... Anyway, so I decided to first think about what applications I wanted to do. 

- Image/ Video processing
- Audio/ voice processing
- SD/DMA applications

Those were my options. So after some research in internet about development platforms I decided to buy the **STM32F746G-discovery** [link](http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/32f746gdiscovery.html). And the reasons were the following:

- Tons of peripherals (including USB ports, SD connector, audio inputs/outputs)
- ADA platform support more info [here](http://www.makewithada.org/getting-started)
- LCD screen
- Not that expensive, about 55 euros.

Now that I got my hardware it was time to install the other things: debugger, cross-compiler, something to flash the platform. 

- **OpenOCD** 0.10.0 as debugger [link](http://openocd.org/) 
- **GNAT** for arm as cross-compiler [link](https://www.adacore.com/download)
- **ST-link** as flasher or programmer, if you are using archlinux, just download from repositories, otherwise just go to GitHub and clone it [link](https://github.com/texane/stlink)

For my development I just use GDB and VIM.
This is the end of the first episode. I'll keep documenting my embedded ADA journey.

I am not an expert in embedded systems yet, so some information here may be wrong or incomplete.
