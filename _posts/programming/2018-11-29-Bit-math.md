I found this amazing [cookbook](https://bisqwit.iki.fi/story/howto/bitmath/) written by [Joel Yliluoma](https://bisqwit.iki.fi/) a.k.a _bisqwit_. 
Just check it if you are interested in bit operations, and it is highly recommended if you work in embedded engineering. 
**Note** Two's complement is assumed. 


Here is an example of Addition without carry

```c
// Using subtraction
uint_type a      = original_1;
uint_type b      = original_2;
b = -b;
uint_type result = a - b;


// Using bitwise operations, with XOR
uint_type a      = original_1;
uint_type b      = original_2;
uint_type carry  = a & b;
uint_type result = a ^ b;
while(carry != 0) {
    // If you need the mathematical carry from addition,
    // check the overflow from this shift.
    uint_type shiftedcarry = carry << 1;
    carry  = result & shiftedcarry;
    result = result ^ shiftedcarry;
}
```

That guy is sick.
