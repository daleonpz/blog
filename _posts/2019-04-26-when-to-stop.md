Sometimes you need to know when to stop. 
You have opened a door just to see what was behind it and that experience could be amazing or bad, but at the end you know you really enjoyed it because it was excited as hell to experience something new.

That memory or lesson will be with you forever. 
The reason behind it is that vigorous emotion has  generated nostalgia when you noticed it was over.
It that moment you must accept that it's over and forcing it will only make it something you will regret for sure.
