Sometimes it is annoying for me when my performance is good but my boss doesn't want to reward me for that. 
His/her rewards is to give me more tasks. wtf! So either I work slower or hide my results until the expected time. And I think that is shit. 

I always try to get all the things done as soon as possible. I like to think that the more time I save working faster, the more time I would have to do something else. 
Just think about it.. It's better for everybody, the employer would have results faster and you would have more spare time.

It's matter of numbers. If the expected performance is 5 but yours is greater, either they should pay you more or allow you more benefits such as go home earlier.  

That's why I like goal-oriented jobs.
