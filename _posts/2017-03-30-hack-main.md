title: Hacking function main
---

I found this [post](http://jroweboy.github.io/c/asm/2015/01/26/when-is-main-not-a-function.html) in which a guy, called James Rowe, successfully compiled a program in which he defined a variable called `main` and made it work as if there was an actually `int main(){...}`.  So, before I finished to read the whole post I decided to try it by myself. 

Last month I solved a `buffer bomb` similar to this one described [here](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15213-s02/www/applications/labs/lab3/buflab.html). Basically I used a [buffer overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow) to write directly on specific memory locations.
The buffer overflow and my knowdlegde in linking, assembly and virtual memory gave me the confidence to try the something similar to James's post.


# The problem
I want to print on my screen `holi boli` by using a code in which I only declare and define a variable called `main`. *Note* this code only works on a x64 Linux machine 

You can find the programs I coded [here](https://github.com/daleonpz/blog/tree/master/_code).

# The result
I ended up with this code:
```c
const char main[] ={
  0x55,                   	
  0x48, 0x89, 0xe5,
  0xb8 , 0x01 , 0x00 , 0x00 , 0x00,
  0xbb , 0x01 , 0x00 , 0x00 , 0x00,
  0xbe , 0x81 , 0x05 , 0x40 , 0x00,    	
  0xba , 0x0a , 0x00 , 0x00 , 0x00,	
  0x0f , 0x05 ,
  0xb8 , 0x3c , 0x00 , 0x00 , 0x00,
  0x0f , 0x05,
  // <message>
  0x68, 0x6f , 0x6c , 0x69 , 0x20 ,
  0x62,
  0x6f,               
  0x6c,                
  0x69 , 0x0a , 0xb8 , 0x00 , 0x00 , 0x00,
  0x00 , 0x5d , 0xc3 ,
  0x0f , 0x1f , 0x84 , 0x00 , 0x00 , 0x00, 0x00, 	
  0x00 
};
```

Of course the output is `holi boli`.

# The process

## First attempt
The first thing I did was to code what I wanted to achieve.
```c
// baseline.c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
	printf("holi boli \n");
}
```

This code is straigthfoward. I compiled `gcc -W -Wall test1.c -o run` and I run `objdump -D run` to see what was the assembly code related to `main`.

```nasm
00000000004004f6 <main>:
  4004f6:	55            	push   %rbp
  4004f7:	48 89 e5      	mov    %rsp,%rbp
  4004fa:	bf 94 05 40 00	mov    $0x400594,%edi
  4004ff:	e8 ec fe ff ff	callq  4003f0 <puts@plt>
  400504:	b8 00 00 00 00	mov    $0x0,%eax
  400509:	5d            	pop    %rbp
  40050a:	c3            	retq   
  40050b:	0f 1f 44 00 00	nopl   0x0(%rax,%rax,1)
```

From now on I will only show the memory locations and opcode not the assembly instructions given by  `objdump -D`, unless it is necessary. 

Based on the concept behind buffer overflow, I can use `char` arrays to write directly into memory. Thus, I na√≠vely did the following:

```c
//test1.c
char main[] = { 0x55,
	0x48, 0x89, 0xe5,
	0xbf, 0x94, 0x05, 0x40, 0x00,
	0xe8, 0xec, 0xfe, 0xff, 0xff,
	0xb8, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
	0x5d,
	0xc3,
	0x0f, 0x1f, 0x44, 0x00, 0x00,
};
```
I compiled and this happened `Illegal instruction (core dumped)`, a segmentation fault. It was kind of expected something similar so I used `objdump -D` to see what was under the hood.

```nasm
Disassembly of section .data:

0000000000601020 <__data_start>:
	...

0000000000601028 <__dso_handle>:
	...

0000000000601030 <main>:
  601030:	55            
  601031:	48 89 e5      
  601034:	bf 94 05 40 00
  601039:	e8 ec fe ff ff  callq  4003f0 <puts@plt>
  60103e:	b8 00 00 00 00
  601043:	5d            
  601044:	c3            
  601045:	0f 1f 44 00 00

```

The key word here is `.data`. Yes my friend, `main` in the `.data` section. For more information about ELF sections I wrote a post about [ELF files](https://daleonpz.com/blog/linking-basics). But if we wanted `char main` to work as if it were "true" code, `main` should be in `.text` section or `.rodata` section.

# Second attempt
I added `const` before `char main` to move from `.data` to `.rodata`.

```c
//test2.c
const char main[] = { 0x55,
	0x48, 0x89, 0xe5,
	0xbf, 0x94, 0x05, 0x40, 0x00,
	0xe8, 0xec, 0xfe, 0xff, 0xff,
	0xb8, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
	0x5d,
	0xc3,
	0x0f, 0x1f, 0x44, 0x00, 0x00,
};
```

I run the code and I got `Illegal instruction (core dumped)`. Another infamous segmentation fault. 
And of course, as you was expected, I used `objdump -D`:

```nasm
Disassembly of section .rodata:

0000000000400530 <_IO_stdin_used>:
  400530:	01 00             
  400532:	02 00             
	...

0000000000400540 <main>:
  400540:	55                
  400541:	48 89 e5          
  400544:	bf 94 05 40 00    
  400549:	e8 ec fe ff ff   
  40054e:	b8 00 00 00 00    
  400553:	5d                
  400554:	c3                
  400555:	0f 1f 44 00 00  
```

Nothing seems to be wrong. So I used `baseline.c` to see what could happen, and I noticed this `4004ff:	e8 ec fe ff ff	callq  4003f0 <puts@plt>`. 
Let's check in which address is the GOT `.plt` for `printf` (`puts@plt`)... Oohhh shit!, obviously the linker didn't link `printf` since there is no referente to that function. Let's  try another approach :)


The GOT or _global offset table_ is used to link functions defined in shared libraries in such a way that instead of loading the whole library, the compiler only uses the function that have references in the code. To learn more you can google it. 
Maybe I will write a post about it, when it happens I will update this post.


The GOT `.plt` for `printf` in `baseline.c` is as follow:

```nasm
00000000004003f0 <puts@plt>:
  4003f0: ff 25 22 0c 20 00    jmpq   *0x200c22(%rip)     
                    ; 601018 <_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_+0x18>
  4003f6: 68 00 00 00 00       pushq  $0x0
  4003fb: e9 e0 ff ff ff       jmpq   4003e0 <_init+0x18>
```
