I am almost 5 months in Germany and my German is decent, at least I can do my everyday life with no problems which means two things:

- I can understand what people say
- I am more fluent

The first one is the one I find my interesting. I still remember when I just came here and every time a person talk to me in German I couldn't get anything, not even a single "Ja". 
But know, even though I don't know the meaning of the words I am able to reproduce them. For example, if somebody says "ich finde das nicht gut", I can actually get each phoneme and be able to ask "was bedeutet _finde_?". 
And I think that's a big accomplishment.

I don't understand how language acquisition works, but for me it is very interesting how my mind evolves.
