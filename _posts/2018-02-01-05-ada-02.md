title: Embedded Ada Journey 002 - Testing my toolchain
category: programming
---

In the last post I talked about the tools I use to do my development and the board I bought. 
Today, I will talk about the first toolchain test I did.

* You should download the *Ada Drivers Library* from [github](https://github.com/AdaCore/Ada_Drivers_Library). 
* Go to `Ada_Drivers_Library/examples/STM32F746_Discovery`, in my case is STM32F746. You will find examples for _STM32F429_, _STM32F469_, _STM32F4_, _STM32F746_, and _STM32F769_
* Execute `gprbuild blinky_f7disco.gpr`. What is GPRbuild? From AdaCore documentation. More info [here](https://docs.adacore.com/gprbuild-docs/html/gprbuild_ug/building_with_gprbuild.html)
> GPRbuild is a generic build tool designed for the construction of large multi-language systems organized into subsystems and libraries. It is well-suited for compiled languages supporting separate compilation, such as Ada, C, C++ and Fortran.

And it has three phases: Compilation, post-compilation (binding) and linking phase
