Yesterday I started reading a new book, and it was written that development is constant and it is done is small parts. So I thought about it and it is so amazing all the things you can learn or improve just by dedicating 5-10 min everyday or even every week. 

For example, in my case:
- My mood it is boosting by 5 minutes of mobility each morning
- Read a book in intervals 10-20 min every 2-3 days.
- Practice playing the harmonica 30 min twice a week.
- An stretching at least 10 minutes before going to bed

It is not much but in the long run it pays off and it is  easier to accomplish things. The hardest part is that it takes discipline.
