title: Price of violence

I remember that when I was younger I used to use violence to "solve" my problems. 
Basically, if someone did something to me, I replied back.
But at some point I realized that violence had a price.
For example, if you beat someone up, most likely you will get some injuries in the process (maybe broken hands, eye inflammations). Or let's say you are angry about something and you get mad with everybody who is front of you, at the end the one who suffers the most it's you.

Just remember not only violence, but everything else has a price... so the question is if you are willing to pay that price. But regarding violence, I just chose not to use it, I don't want to pay that price.
