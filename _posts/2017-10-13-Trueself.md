I was reading the synopsis of a new anime called "Inuyashiki", it says that the main character is a war machine and he will be facing moral issues. Anyway... So I question came to my mind "How many people in our current society will kill other if there were no punishment at all?" inspired also by the movie "The Purge".

```

* Why do people who choose to kill do it? They just want to kill other for fun or revenge or pleasure? They want to know what it feels to kill someone? 
* The people who choose not to kill, did they choose that because of a moral issue (they think it is bad to kill others)  or because they think that killing people is not an efficient solution to the more profound problem?

It was a random thought... nothing deep. But question like that I think can give us information about ourselves.
