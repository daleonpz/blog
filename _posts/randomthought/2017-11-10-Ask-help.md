Today I was reading the whatsapp group of our master program and there was one girl that couldn't register in the city because she doesn't speak german, so she was asking for help to see if somebody may help her as translator in her next meeting. 
 Immediately, people started to give several options but no one offered what she wanted, a translator. 
From what I could see is that she were not that open to accept that she may be deal with her problem by herself.
So I thought... she was not the only one with that problem and many people managed their way out, for example myself. And then, I remembered that in Peru when people ask for a favor their are not expecting a "no" as an answer. 

```
凸ಠ益ಠ)凸 .... Fuck you, everybody!

I think that it's okay to ask for help, but don't expect people to help you. I don't like people who think they are helpless and they have the right to be mad with people just because you believe they must help you.
Also, if you are having troubles with something, I believe, it is up to you how that problem affects you and you are the only who must do something in first place.
