I was thinking about why it's easier for me to "connect" with someone in person than using just text messages. 
I am not the best writer ever, but the problem is that I find really difficult to come up with a good message. By that I mean a message that can "connect" with the other person.
Maybe the reason behind is that I cannot see other person reactions (emotional responses)..

I heard this phrase "people buy emotions and justify with logic" in some marketing conference. 
Maybe that's the reason behind my poor text messaging skills. I am so used to react to the emotional responses in face to face meetings that the lack of that information limits my performance. I cannot make them buy my stuff since I don't know to which emotion I should  link my words to.

Maybe I should start doing my homework.
