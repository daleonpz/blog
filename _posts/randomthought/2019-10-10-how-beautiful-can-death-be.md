My flat is in front of  the Dortmund Harbor. 
From there I can see big leafy trees and the canal that goes through the north part of the city.

Today I was looking the sunset through my window. 
It's October in Germany and I had this amazing view of the orange sky and falling leafs over the water. 


**<center>... I started thinking about death. </center>**

Sunsets and falling leafs are  constant death reminders.
But aren't  these two events incredibly beautiful to look at? 

So, why not see death in the same way?

> Call for the grandest of all earthly spectacles, what is that? It is the sun going to his rest. ― Thomas de Quincey 

Maybe the _SUNSET_ of our life is unbelievable and beautiful experience. 
But we may miss it.
Because we can't take breaks to look at our life. 

Let me tell you something. When your time comes...

**<center> Enjoy and contemplate YOUR SUNSET  </center>**
