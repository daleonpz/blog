My flat is in front of  the Dortmund Harbor. 
From there I can see big leafy trees and the canal that goes through the north part of the city.

It's October in Germany. So it's the season in which the leafs turn brownish, and start to fall.

Today I was looking the sunset through my window. 
I had a amazing view of the orange sky. 

Suddenly...

**<center> I started thinking about death. </center>**

Sunsets and falling leafs are, in some sense, a constant death reminders.
But think about.. Aren't  these two events incredibly beautiful to look at? 

So, why not see death in the same way?

Maybe the _SUNSET_ of our life is unbelievable and beautiful experience. 
But we may miss it.
Because we can't take breaks to look at our life. 

> Call for the grandest of all earthly spectacles, what is that? It is the sun going to his rest. ― Thomas de Quincey 

Think about it...

When your time comes...

**<center> Enjoy and contemplate YOUR SUNSET  </center>**
