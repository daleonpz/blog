My flat is in front of  the Dortmund Harbor. 
From there I can see big leafy trees and the canal that goes through the north part of the city.

It's October in Germany. So it's the season in which the leafs turn brownish, and start to fall.

Today I was looking the sunset through my window. 
I had a amazing view of the orange sky. 

Suddenly...

**<center> I started thinking about death. </center>**

Sunsets and falling leafs are, in some sense, a constant death reminders.
But think about.. Aren't  these two events incredibly beautiful to look at? 

So, why not see death in the same way?

Maybe the _SUNSET_ of our life is unbelievable and beautiful experience. 
But we may miss it. 
Because we are constantly thinking on how much we don't want to die.

> Live Your life. Do Your Work. Then Take Your Hat - Henry David Thoreau

Maybe we should do the same. 
When we are close to our death.
