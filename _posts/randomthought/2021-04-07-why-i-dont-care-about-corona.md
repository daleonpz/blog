I don't care about the discussions about corona. 

They don't interest me. because it's not my area of expertise, it's a global pandemic, which means there many people way more qualified than me working on solving that problem.

Should I trust them?... Yes. Trust is what allows us to live in society. And as I said, it's not my area of expertise.

They may wrong... well, I would say, we're still learning about this virus. We already knew some shit, but there are still things we don't know. But they're still researching and performing tests, things just take time. It's impossible to fully understand a problem from the very beginning.  Corona is something new and this virus is evolving. 

That being said. I trust science. Politicians never. but I trust facts and numbers.

If I have the option the get the vaccine. I'll do it. Because it's supported by evidence and numbers. There is always a risk of course, but for me, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.  That simple. 

To finish this. 

I don't take part in corona discussions because I have better things to do. 

But if that answer doesn't satisfy you. Here are more reasons:

- I said. I trust science and numbers. 1 is 1. And there is no discussion about that.
- I don't take an active part in politics. Discussions about  Corona, in my perspective, are political.
- Discussions about morality. Well, for me it's simple. We are together in this. So, don't fuck others. 


I already made my mind. Get a vaccine, when possible. The benefits outweigh the drawbacks. However, it's okay to have fear and doubts.

My advice is education. Talk with experts, read, look at the facts and numbers.
