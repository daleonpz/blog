Sometimes you need to know when to stop. 
You opened a door just to see what was behind it and that experience could be amazing or bad, but at the end you know you really enjoyed it because it was excited as hell to do something new.

That memory or lesson will be with you forever. 
The reason behind it is that a vigorous emotion makes you nostalgic when you noticed it is over.
You must accept that moment of your life is gone and forcing it will only make it something you will regret for sure.
