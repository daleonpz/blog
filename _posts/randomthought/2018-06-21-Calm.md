In the last days I've been listening to chill music and I just thought about how important is to keep the calm.
Even under harsh conditions you should keep calm and think. 
The solution of the problem is only reachable when you focus and think clearly.

It's hard too keep calm, but just like any other skill you must practice it as often as possible.
Eventually your mind will enter in this state by default.
