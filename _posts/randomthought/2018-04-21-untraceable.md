Yesterday, in my third day without smartphone or cellphone,  I was going to another city in Germany by train and I felt that nobody actually could know where I was. 
I felt like I could disappear without leaving any trace at all. 
Google didn't know where I was.

It felt so great, maybe I ll start having no cellphone days.
