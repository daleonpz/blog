On the evening of September 18th, I came back from Turkey. 
When I was in Germany waiting for my train on the platform to finally go home.
I received a notification that I was charged 60 euros for 3 minutes of Whatsapp I used in Turkey.

I know, I know... My roaming plan is not the best.

I only had 300 euros until the end of the month in my everyday account.

My rent back then was 210. Not a big deal, right?...Well, not exactly. 

I also had to pay for 10 euros (cellphone plan). That means I only had 20 euros to survive 12 days, plus 4 euros and something in cash that I had in my pocket at that moment.

I didn't want to change my food habits only to survive 12 days with 20 euros. And I didn't  want to borrow money either. 

**<center> I was scared and anxious...</center>**
**<center> I felt LOST.</center>**


A few meters away from where I was, there was a man in his mid-forties asking for money. He needed it for his train ticket. Since he looked like a homeless man some people didn't give him money.

Then I lost sight of him. I was focused on complaining about my situation. 

Suddenly, from nowhere, the man told me something. I didn't look at him, not even heard what he said..."No", I just said.

**<center>"I won't give him anything, not even a cent... I NEED this money", I thought. </center>**

Soon after that thought went through my mind, few more came across...

**<center> wait... I shouldn't stress about money...</center>**
**<center> This is WRONG.</center>**

So, I did something.

I run towards the man and told me "I'll help you". I gave him all my money without hesitation. Smiling, I said "Goodbye, have a nice day" and walked away.

In my heart, I knew I had to do it. Not because it was the right thing, but for me... **To help me**.

I took my train 4 minutes after that. And for the whole journey back home I was relaxed. No more anxiety. No more fear. No more stress.

In the end, money comes and goes. You'll get stolen. Emergencies will show up. There will be a recession... You are going to lose money no matter what. It's a fact... And it doesn't depend on you at all.


But you can, on the flip side, make always more money. And ...

**It depends 100% on you.**
