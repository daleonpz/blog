I don't understand why there are so many vegans trying to make vegan food similar to non-vegan food, and the worst part is that they use names such as "vegan cheese" or "vegan mayonnaise".
For god's sake, why they don't create new dishes, instead of trying to make vegan food a fake version of the non-vegan.

I think it will be more appealing to non-vegan community if vegans offer another option that has not the intention to be a bad copy of non-vegan food.
Just think for a second, would you be more willing to try a dish called "vegan something" or a new dish, that doesn't have the word vegan or salad in its name, but only contains veggies/fruits?
