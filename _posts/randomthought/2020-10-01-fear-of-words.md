People should be able to say what they want but... as long as they don't the
intention of harming.

As a rule of thumb, we shouldn't use violence at all.

I talk about the price of violence in another [post]({% post_url

**<center> Words are a powerful tool... But words can also "hurt". </center>**

But it depends a lot on the receiver person. Whereas physical violence is
tangible. Words damage is subjective.

                  |  "How I met your mother"     | 
                  |            is better than    |
                  |       "Friends"              |

For example, when a kid says "You, idiot!" to you. You ignore him.. but when a
stranger in the supermall says "You, idiot!". You may beat him up.

Same words, different outcomes. 

Some people say that... 

**<center> It's doesn't matter what you say, you will for sure offense somebody.</center>**


That's why it would help to focus on developing emotional stable people. 

In the end...

Our goal is not to offend is to **learn how to understand others and control our emotions**.
