When was the last time you felt alive?

I ask myself the same question at least once a year. And guess what... 

So far, I couldn't find a satisfactory answer.

Should we start then with... what's the meaning of life?

You and I are not the first to ask that question, and we are not going to be the last. 
From Socrates and Confucius to  Camus and Sartre, many people thought about the answer.

However, your life may have no specific meaning. Think about it...

> You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.” ― Albert Camus

In the end, maybe the meaning of your life is just that... **Living**.

Live on your own terms. In my case these are my principles:

* Be in the present, it is the only moment that I can do something. 
* Avoid boredom. Feel alive, I am here to enjoy this game called life.
* Shit happens, so laugh.
* Be in peace with myself. I am the only person with whom I will be my whole life.

If you are still uneasy with your life. Well... Say "fuck everything!". And Relax.
