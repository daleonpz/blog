When was the last time you left alive?

I ask myself the same question at least once a year. And you what... 

So far, I couldn't find a satisfactory answer.

Should we start then with... what's the meaning of life?

You and I are not the first ask that question, and we are going to be the last. 
From Socrates and Confucius to  Camus and Sartre, many people thought about the answer.

However, you live may have no specific meaning. Do you think about it? 

> You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.” ― Albert Camus

In the end, maybe the meaning of your life is just that... **Living**.

Live on your own terms. In my case these are my principles:

* Live in the present, it is the only moment that I can do something. 
* Avoid boredom. Feel alive, I am here to enjoy this game called life.
* Shit happens, so laugh.
* Be in peace with myself. I am the only person with whom I will be my whole life.

If you still unsatisfied with the life, well just say "fuck everything, I'll chill out!"
