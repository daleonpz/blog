_Shawshank Redemption_ is my favourite film. I watched at least 10 times in the last 5 years. 
And that phrase is carved on my brain.

Institutionalized, for me, means to **not living on your own terms** and be afraid to do something about it.
Because you feel "safe" in your current situation, even if you hate it or complain all the time about it.

Remember...

Look at your current life and ask yourself... 

Do I really want this? Do I really want to be in the same situation in 5, 10 or  20 years?
