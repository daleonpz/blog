Today I was working on a project with a friend. We're launching soon a podcast, so we met today to work on the "episode list" page.

He's a professional web developer. But he doesn't have too much free time. He shares his time with his job, hobbies, family, and kids.
That's why I'm doing the website. 

After all, I made this blog, so I had some experience... I think.

At the beginning of our small hackathon, I showed him the current code and he just laughed. 
The code was chaos. I didn't respect any rules of software design. 

> I showed him the current code and he just laughed. 

I just wanted to make it work... Somehow.

He gave me some tips and we kept developing the site. My role was mainly supportive. 
After 4 hours we got stuck. He was trying to make our code work. while I was playing around with the code, trying to apply what he showed me and seeing if it worked.

After 30 min of hard-working, I made it worked. 

> He asked me how I did it. "I tried to apply the tips you gave me before and it worked", I replied.

I still remember the feeling when he showed me the basics and my mind just started to play with all the things I could do. It was as I was discovered the fire.
