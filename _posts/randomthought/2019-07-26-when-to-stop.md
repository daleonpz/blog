Sometimes you need to know when to stop. 

Have you ever enjoyed that thrilling moment when you were about to experience something new? So you opened a door just to see what was behind it.  You were a kid again at that moment.  Because the excitement was over all your body. And that memory will be with you forever.

The reason behind is that a vigorous emotion makes you nostalgic. When you notice it’s over. You must accept that moment of your life is gone. And you should go on. Otherwise  you will regret for sure.
