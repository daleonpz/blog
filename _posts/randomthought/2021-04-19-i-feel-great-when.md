I'm a selfish, lazy ,and simple person. 

I mean my life and stuff are my top priority, I don't want to spend a lot of time on the same task and I don't like complicated things.

That's why I feel great when:
- I work on my own projects and have full autonomy.
- I see that I don't have many belongings. Having many things stress me. More things I need to care about. no, no, no. 
- I develop a simple system. Having a system helps me to be creative and productive. Because I don't waste time and energy on tasks that have already been automated by the system. For example, I don't think anymore about my breakfast, because I already have a list of items that I like, I know when and how I'll eat, and I know I'll enjoy it. 
- I read a book that tells me how to achieve something. I'm lazy, I don't have to reinvent the wheel if somebody else knows the answer.

That's all I could think of until now. :)
