I met this incredible woman almost two months ago, and today a question came to my mind: How much time do you need so you can say that you know someone? 

``` 
            ________________________
           |                        |
           | I don't want to think! |
           |________________________|
(∩⌣̀_⌣́)  _____|

 ```

From my personal experience I concluded a couple of things:
* People change overtime, even you. So You will never actually know someone 100 percent.
* Knowing someone is more about quality over quantity of time. 

Just think about...
