title: Application Binary Interface (ABI) 
category: programming
---


When I started to develop embedded systems based on ARM-based chips I used the `arm-none-eabi-gcc` compiler.
I always wondered what was the meaning of  `eabi`.  
**EABI** stands for _Embedded Application Binary Interface_, but what is an application binary interface or ABI?  
I will try to explain what I understood the best I can. 



The ABI is related to ELF-based files. 
I wrote a post about [elf basics]({% post_url 2017-02-11-linking-basics %}) some time ago.
In one hand  ELF files contain a header that give us information that will help the linker to parse and interpret the object file.
On the other hand, ABI specifies the content and format of ELF-files, such as the [calling conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calling_convention).
We could say that a ELF-based file for an specific architecture have some structure and rules defined by the ABI.  


An ELF header for ARM architecture generated by `arm-eabi-gnat` 

```sh
ELF Header:
  Magic:   7f 45 4c 46 01 01 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 
  Class:                     ELF32
  Data:                      2 s complement, little endian
  Version:                   1 (current)
  OS/ABI:                    UNIX - System V
  ABI Version:               0
  Type:                      EXEC (Executable file)
  Machine:                   ARM
  Version:                   0x1
  Entry point address:       0x801e799
  Start of program headers:  52 (bytes into file)
  Start of section headers:  965452 (bytes into file)
  Flags:                     0x5000400, Version5 EABI, hard-float ABI
  Size of this header:       52 (bytes)
  Size of program headers:   32 (bytes)
  Number of program headers: 4
  Size of section headers:   40 (bytes)
  Number of section headers: 20
```

An here is a ELF-header for x86_64 architecture generated by `gcc` 

```sh
ELF Header:
  Class:                    ELF64
  Data:                     2 s complement, little endian
  Version                   1 (current)
  OS/ABI:                   UNIX - System V
  Type:                     EXEC (Executable file)
  Machine                   Advanced Micro Devices X86-64
  Entry point address:      0x4003b0
  Start of program headers: 64 (bytes into file)
  Start of section headers: 6568 (bytes into file)
  Size of this header:      64 (bytes)
  Size of program headers:  56 (bytes)
  Number of program headers:9
  Size of section headers:  64 (bytes)
  Number of section headers:28
```


 Two systems can be considered **binary compatible** if they can run the same software without requiring that the application be recompiled. 
For example, the system that can run the ELF file generated by `gcc` is not binary compatible with the one that can run the ELF file generated by `arm-eabi-gnat`, they are from different classes, have different header size and machine type.
