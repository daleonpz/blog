Hi ᶘ ᵒᴥᵒᶅ,  

Sometimes you have questions about you, your life or society popping up in your head with no reason.
Let me tell you... You are not the only one. 

That's why I started this blog. 

My name is Daniel. 
I'm passionate about human psychology. 
And I'm always trying to understand how my mind works. 

Here I share with you my deepest thoughts. 
But be careful, what you read is enjoyable and almost eye-opener. 

If you are ready. 
All you have to do is start reading my last [post]({% for post in site.categories.randomthought limit: 1%}{{ post.url }}   {% endfor %}).


Enjoy this day!
